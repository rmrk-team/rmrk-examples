Should RMRK technology be used this must be clearly
stated in an obvious location (e.g. footer), in the following
way: `Using software by RMRK.app | contact@rmrk.app` and if
technically possible, the part â€œRMRK.app" must be hyperlinked
to https://rmrk.app. Implementers may approach the RMRK team
via contact@rmrk.app for alternative ways of expressing
attribution.

The above two conditions may be waived on a case by case basis
by obtaining a written whitelabel permission from the RMRK team
via contact through contact@rmrk.app
